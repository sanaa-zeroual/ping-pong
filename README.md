### Sanaa (szeroual) - ~15%

As the AI Developer, responsible for designing and implementing the intelligent AI opponent system (Major module: 2 pts):

#### AI Opponent System Implementation

**Ball Trajectory Prediction Algorithm** (`ai_predect.py`)
- Implements predictive collision detection by simulating ball physics
- Iteratively calculates ball position based on velocity vectors (vx, vy)
- Accounts for wall bounces (top/bottom screen boundaries)
- Returns predicted paddle target Y-coordinate for ball collision
- Core algorithm: Simulates ball movement until it reaches CPU paddle X position, accounting for reflections

**Error Modeling System** (`ai_error.py`)
- Introduces human-like imperfection in AI decision-making
- Applies configurable random errors to predicted target positions
- Different error amounts per difficulty level (Easy: ±40px, Medium: ±20px, Hard: ±5px)
- Makes AI beatable and provides skill progression

**Reaction Time Simulation** (`ai_reaction.py`)
- Simulates human reaction delays using probability-based activation
- Configurable reaction values per difficulty:
  - Easy: 30% chance to react (slower responses)
  - Medium: 60% chance to react
  - Hard: 90% chance to react (near-perfect reactivity)
- Implemented using `random.random()` for realistic behavior

**Difficulty System Architecture** (`difficulty.py`)
- Three balanced difficulty levels with independent parameters:
  - **Easy**: Speed 6, Error ±40px, Reaction 30%, Prediction 0.1 (minimal prediction strength)
  - **Medium**: Speed 8, Error ±20px, Reaction 60%, Prediction 0.3
  - **Hard**: Speed 12, Error ±5px, Reaction 90%, Prediction 0.7 (strong prediction)
- Configurable parameters allow fine-tuning for game balance

**AI Decision Engine** (`cpu_ai.py`)
- Main orchestrator combining all AI components:
  1. Check if AI should react based on reaction probability
  2. Predict ball trajectory to get target Y position
  3. Apply prediction strength scaling for difficulty variation
  4. Add human-like errors to target position
  5. Compare paddle center with target and return direction (-1, 0, +1)
- Returns paddle movement direction: -1 (up), 0 (stationary), +1 (down)

#### Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. **Precise trajectory prediction**: Ball velocity changes due to paddle collisions → Solution: Iteratively simulated physics until ball reaches CPU paddle X position
2. **Balancing difficulty**: AI was too perfect or too weak → Solution: Implemented multi-parameter difficulty system with speed, error, reaction, and prediction strength
3. **Realistic human behavior**: AI movements appeared robotic → Solution: Combined reaction delays with error modeling to create believable AI mistakes
4. **Integration with game engine**: AI predictions needed to work with canvas-based physics → Solution: Tightly integrated with game physics calculations

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with `game_engine.py` for single-player AI-opponent mode
- Works with game physics system for accurate ball trajectory calculation
- Configurable difficulty selection in game mode settings
- Seamless integration with existing game score tracking and win conditions

3. **Real-time sync**: Game state consistency across clients → Solution: Server-authoritative game state with WebSocket broadcasts

### Assia (amabchou) - ~15%

#### Monitoring & Observability Infrastructure

**Prometheus Configuration**
- Configured `prometheus.yml` with multi-target scraping from 6 core services:
  - **Django Backend**: HTTPS scraping on port 8001 using `django-prometheus` middleware
  - **cAdvisor**: Container resource metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk) on port 8080
  - **Node Exporter**: Host/container OS metrics on port 9100
  - **PostgreSQL Exporter**: Database performance metrics (connections, queries, cache) on port 9187
  - **Redis Exporter**: Cache metrics (hit rate, memory usage) on port 9121
  - **Grafana**: Self-monitoring metrics on port 3001
- **Scraping Configuration**:
  - Configured `scheme: https` for Django backend
  - Added `insecure_skip_verify: true` for self-signed development certificates
  - Set appropriate scrape intervals (15s for critical services, 30s for others)

**Grafana Dashboard Development**
  - Unified Service Monitoring: Developed a centralized Command Center on port 3001 that aggregates data from 6 distinct scrape jobs defined in Prometheus:

     * Backend Health (Django): Monitors the Daphne ASGI server via HTTPS (port 8001), tracking basic HTTP response codes and endpoint availability.

     * Container Analytics (cAdvisor): Visualizes real-time CPU and Memory consumption across all running containers to prevent resource bottlenecks.

     * Hardware Metrics (Node Exporter): Tracks host-level performance including disk I/O and network traffic.

  - Database & Cache Oversight:
     * PostgreSQL: Monitors active connection counts and database uptime via postgres_exporter.

     * Redis: Tracks memory footprints and cache layer stability via redis_exporter.

  - Infrastructure Alerting: Configured baseline alerts to notify the team of service downtime or critical resource exhaustion:

     * Service "Up" Status: Immediate alerts if any core service (Database, Redis, or Backend) stops responding to Prometheus scrapes.

     * Resource Thresholds: Monitoring for memory usage spikes (>80%) that could lead to container crashes.

**Infrastructure Security**
- Implemented SSL/TLS scraping for Django backend metrics
- Handled self-signed certificate validation in Prometheus
- Secured Grafana with admin credentials

**Docker Networking Configuration**
- Resolved container networking issues for Prometheus scraping
- Configured `container_name` resolution across the `transcendence_network`
- Ensured all services accessible via internal container names (e.g., `backend`, `redis`, `postgres`)
- Re-mapped cAdvisor to host port 8003 to avoid conflicts while maintaining internal port 8080

#### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Django HTTPS Scraping Issue**
   - **Challenge**: Django running on HTTPS/Daphne caused "Connection Refused" for Prometheus
   - **Solution**: Configured Prometheus with `scheme: https` and `insecure_skip_verify: true` to handle self-signed development certificates. For production, this would use proper CA certificates.

2. **cAdvisor Port Conflicts**
   - **Challenge**: cAdvisor default port 8080 conflicted with other services
   - **Solution**: Re-mapped cAdvisor to host port 8003 using `ports: "8003:8080"` while maintaining internal communication on port 8080 for Prometheus scraping

3. **Container Name Resolution**
   - **Challenge**: Prometheus couldn't reach containers by name across Docker network
   - **Solution**: Ensured all containers connected to `transcendence_network` and used `container_name` for consistent DNS resolution (e.g., `targets: ['backend:8001']`)

4. **Metric Cardinality Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Too many unique metric labels caused Prometheus memory bloat
   - **Solution**: Limited label cardinality by aggregating low-level metrics and dropping unused labels in Prometheus configuration

5. **Dashboard Performance**
   - **Challenge**: Grafana dashboards slow with high-resolution time series data
   - **Solution**: Implemented query downsampling for older data, used Prometheus recording rules for pre-aggregated metrics

#### Monitoring Coverage
- **Application Layer**: Django request metrics, error tracking, endpoint latency
- **Container Layer**: cAdvisor resource usage (CPU, memory, network I/O)
- **System Layer**: Node Exporter OS metrics (disk usage, system load)
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL performance (connection pools, query performance)
- **Cache Layer**: Redis performance (hit rates, memory usage)

#### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- Created monitoring setup documentation
- Documented Prometheus scrape configuration
- Provided Grafana dashboard JSON exports
- Documented alert thresholds and escalation procedures

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: v20.x or higher
- **Docker Compose**: v2.x or higher
- **Make**: For running Makefile commands
- **Modern browser**: Chrome (required), Firefox, Edge, or Safari

For manual setup (without Docker):
- **Python**: v3.10 or higher
- **Node.js**: v18.x or higher
- **npm**: v9.x or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: v14.x or higher
- **Redis**: v7.x or higher

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mel-mehdi/ft_mohsinine.git
   cd ft_mohsinine
   ```

2. **Create the root environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   The default values are for local development. Change them for production.

3. **Generate SSL certificates**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate-ssl.sh
   ./generate-ssl.sh
   ```
   This creates self-signed certificates for local HTTPS development.

4. **If you changed `POSTGRES_*` values after first run**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make up
   ```
   This recreates containers/volumes so Postgres credentials match the updated `.env`.

### Installation & Running

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Build and start all services**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   Or use docker-compose directly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: https://localhost:8443
   - Backend API: https://localhost:8443/api
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser

3. **Useful Makefile commands**:
   ```bash
   make up       # Start containers
   make down     # Stop containers
   make re       # Rebuild and restart
   make logs     # View container logs
   make clean    # Remove containers and volumes
   ```

4. **Stop services**:
   ```bash
   make down
   # or
   docker-compose down
   ```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL and Redis** (required services):
   ```bash
   # Using Docker for databases only
   docker-compose up -d database redis
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:

### Browser Compatibility

The application has been tested and verified on:
- ✅ Google Chrome (latest stable version) - **Required**
- ✅ Mozilla Firefox (latest stable version)
- ✅ Microsoft Edge (latest stable version)
- ✅ Safari (latest stable version)

### Troubleshooting

**Port conflicts**:
```bash
# Check what's using port 8001
lsof -i :8001
# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Database errors**:
```bash
# If POSTGRES_* values changed after first startup, reset DB volume
make clean
make up

# Or manually reset migrations
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```

If you still see authentication failures, verify `.env` uses non-placeholder values and that `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are aligned.

**WebSocket connection issues**:
```bash
# Check Redis is running
docker-compose ps redis

# Restart backend to reconnect
docker-compose restart backend
```

**HTTPS issues**:
- For local development, accept self-signed certificate warning
- Regenerate certificates: `./generate-ssl.sh`
- For production, configure proper SSL certificates in nginx config

**Docker issues**:
```bash
# Rebuild containers from scratch
make clean
make build

# View logs
make logs
# or
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### AI Usage

This section details how AI tools and algorithms were used throughout the project, distinguishing between AI-assisted development and custom AI algorithm implementation.

#### AI Algorithms Implemented (Sanaa - szeroual)

The AI opponent system implements several core algorithms from game AI theory:

**1. Ball Trajectory Prediction**
- **Purpose**: Predict where the ball will be when it reaches the CPU paddle
- **Algorithm**: Physics-based simulation with iterative position calculation
- **Implementation**: Accounts for ball velocity, paddle position, and wall bounces
- **References**: Classic Pong AI algorithm from game development literature

**2. Error Modeling**
- **Purpose**: Introduce human-like imperfection to create realistic difficulty scaling
- **Algorithm**: Random error application with configurable bounds
- **Implementation**: Random distribution of errors applied to target position
- **Difficulty Progression**: Error ranges from ±5px (Hard) to ±40px (Easy)

**3. Reaction Time Simulation**
- **Purpose**: Simulate delayed human reflexes
- **Algorithm**: Probability-based decision activation
- **Implementation**: Random number generator with difficulty-based thresholds
- **Effect**: Varies from 30% (Easy) to 90% (Hard) successful reactions

**4. Multi-Parameter Difficulty System**
- **Purpose**: Create smooth difficulty progression without making AI feel cheap
- **Parameters**: Speed, Error Amount, Reaction Probability, Prediction Strength
- **Balance**: Each difficulty level is independently tuned for fair competitive play

**Justification of AI Choices**
- **Why trajectory prediction**: Allows AI to make intelligent paddle positioning decisions based on ball physics
- **Why error modeling**: Creates skill progression without requiring complete AI rewrites; maintains playability
- **Why reaction delays**: Makes AI behavior feel more human and less perfect; adds strategic depth
- **Why multi-parameter system**: Provides fine-grained difficulty control for competitive balance and player progression

#### AI Tools Used for Code Assistance

GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT were used for:

**Code Structure & Boilerplate**
- API route generation (mel-mehdi)

- Documentation comments and JSDoc (both)

**Problem Solving & Debugging**
- Algorithm optimization suggestions (mel-mehdi)
- Debugging game physics issues (mel-mehdi)
- Security best practices (mel-mehdi)
- AI parameter tuning suggestions (szeroual)
- Troubleshooting Prometheus SSL/TLS scraping issues (amabchou)

**Documentation**
- Privacy Policy & Terms of Service drafting (mel-mehdi)

- Prometheus HTTPS scraping configuration (amabchou)

#### Parts Implemented WITHOUT AI Code Generation

**AI Implementation (Sanaa - szeroual)**
- Ball trajectory prediction algorithm: Custom implementation from physics principles
- Error modeling system: Custom random error distribution
- Reaction time simulation: Custom probability-based implementation
- Difficulty parameter tuning: Manual testing and balancing via gameplay testing
- All AI decision logic: Hand-coded orchestration and integration

**Game & Backend (Mehdi - mel-mehdi)**
- Game engine core logic: Collision detection, ball physics (custom implementation)
- Tournament state machine: Bracket progression and match management
- Architecture decisions: Technology choices and system design
- Database schema: Entity relationships and data structure
- Security implementation: Authentication flow and session management

**Monitoring (Assia - amabchou)**
- Prometheus configuration structure and scrape target selection
- Monitoring metric selection and alert thresholds
- Grafana dashboard design and panel layout
- Monitoring strategy and metric collection approach
- Prometheus scrape intervals and retention policies
- Grafana alert threshold values

All AI code was custom-implemented, extensively tested through gameplay, and carefully integrated with the game engine. AI assistance tools were used only for code structure suggestions and debugging, not for algorithm design or core implementation.
